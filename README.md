# smilify
A wrapper for the xyz2mol flavor we use in [cell2mol](https://github.com/lcmd-epfl/cell2mol) to turn an xyz into an rdkit mol with bonds. Putting this here because I somehow always end up having to write this over and over.
Note that smilify is significantly slower than the rdkit [rdDetermineBonds](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2022-12-18-introducing-rdDetermineBonds.html) implementation (specially for large conjugated molecules!) and also uses the [xyz2mol](https://github.com/jensengroup/xyz2mol) code as introduced by Jan Jensen et al. as its core. However, we tried our best to extend it to other elements. On top of that, this one loops over covalent thresholds, which should make it a bit more robust in funky cases.
